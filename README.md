The Permalist Project is a Database project to create to-do list with persistant data. This was a part of the Full Stack Web Dev course I am learning from.
 
Database used is PostgreSQL, Node.Js/Express.JS used to create the application. This is my first use of dotenv to keep local evnvironment variables separate, but I included a .env.example file to be used as a template. 

To run the app copy the .env.example file to a .env file and fill in your preferred local port #, and your database credentials. 

You will need a database, with a table that includes two fields "id" and "title" to store you're to-do list data.
